# Migration coverage ledger

This infrastructure change keeps the eight v1.7.2 runtime files, root ZIP and
checksum byte-for-byte unchanged. It consolidates the local master's 55 test
methods into 50, then adds five distribution/isolation regressions: 55 methods
in total. The count is an inventory, not an acceptance score.

| Original area | Public location | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 17 rhythm regressions in `test_helpers.py` | `test_rhythm.py` (17) | Retained, including rational timing, ties/rests, boundaries, pitch, approval and Strict/Adaptive distinctions. |
| Count cases in `test_helpers.py`, `test_release.py`, `test_evidence_status.py` | `test_counts.py` (11) | Consolidated by behavior: bilingual filtering, one-character and mixed lines, extra lines, UTF-8 pipes, variants, malformed slots and missing files. |
| Checker evidence tests | `test_evidence_status.py` (5) | Retained: no-checks needs review, no false assertion certification, extra lines and nonpass CLI status. |
| Architecture contracts | `test_architecture.py` (5) | Retained with invented hook text: 4+4 segmentation, six parallel hooks, annotated relations and speaker roles. |
| Seven workflow substring tests plus rule-inventory test | `test_contracts.py` (3), `fixtures/rule_inventory.json` | Merged into 44 declaration checks, explicit default/retired-rejection checks and a formatting-tolerance regression. Exact example wording is not a quality test. |
| Nine release/archiver tests | `test_release.py` (14) | Nine retained; five added for published ZIP/source agreement, bad/missing checksum, version progression, output isolation and protected source folders. |

The former rule inventory contained **44** entries; its old `45` comment was
incorrect. IDs R01-R44 make the public inventory explicit. Removed brittle
assertions checked the literal wording of three native-Chinese examples.
Corresponding guidance remains unchanged in the runtime; its quality must be
tested with fresh candidate reviews, not equality to those example phrases.

## Fixtures and validation boundaries

- `cases.json`: 44 scenarios retained, E01-E44. The E18/E19 hook passage was
  replaced by invented material preserving the six-line and 4+4 test contracts.
  These scenarios still require fresh agent outputs and human assessment.
- `architecture.json`: annotated roles/relations and invented hook lines. Passing
  means the annotations satisfy the fixture contract, not inferred semantic fidelity.
- `example_level_b.md`: invented bilingual 8/6/8/6 counter example.
- `checker_replays.json`: three synthetic replies covering each checker status.
- `historical_checker_expectations.json`: status metadata only. The original
  17 reply files are optional local inputs and are not published.

CI performs a build with no private history or third-party Python packages.
It does not run the 44 scenarios against a model, transcribe a real score,
certify an installation platform or conduct a singer trial. Source intake and
PDF/numbered-notation workflows are separate future changes.
